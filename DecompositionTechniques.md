This document outlines techniques for decomposing a monolithic application into a microservices architecture.

---

## **1. Decompose by Business Capabilities**  
- Split the monolith into services based on organizational functions (e.g., Billing, Shipping).
- Encapsulate both logic and data within each service.

---

## **2. Decompose by Domain-Driven Design Subdomains**  
- Break down the application into core, supporting, and generic subdomains.
- Ensure services communicate via APIs or events.

---

## **3. Decompose by Use Cases or Workflows**  
- Split the monolith based on user workflows (e.g., user registration, product search).
- Replace monolithic workflows with microservices gradually.

---

## **4. Strangler Fig Pattern**  
- Incrementally replace parts of the monolith with microservices while keeping the monolith operational.
- Route specific functionality to new microservices and retire the monolith over time.

---

## **5. Database Decomposition**  
- Decouple the monolithic database into smaller, service-specific databases.
- Synchronize and migrate data incrementally while using an anti-corruption layer.

---

## **6. Decompose by Resource Aggregation**  
- Group functionality based on shared resources or data aggregation.
- Create microservices to manage specific resources.

---

## **7. Event-Driven Decomposition**  
- Identify domain events ("ProductStockCreated") and build services around event producers and consumers.
- Handle events asynchronously between services.

---

## **8. Decompose by Technical Functionality**  
- Isolate technical functionalities (notifications, authentication).
- Create shared, reusable services for these functionalities.
